Troubleshooting and Best Practices for working with the ORG2 Platform.

* Adobe AIR version is currently 2.0.3

If you have problems updating to the 2.0.3, uninstall any existing Adobe AIR installations from your machine and install 2.0.3.  I ran into an issue where I was unable to uninstall 1.5.3 until I used the Microsoft Installer Cleanup tool and then installed 2.0.3.  This tool has been discontinued and is no longer available at the Microsoft site.  However, I have a copy and am currently looking for an alternative.

* Adobe !FlashBuilder complains about "invalid application descriptor: descriptor version does not match runtime version"

You will need to update your !FlashBuilder installation to the latest version from Adobe.  I ran into the issue when running the 4.0 SDK and the latest SDK to support the 2.0.3 AIR version is 4.0.1.  You can download updaters from this link:

*Development Tools
I am using Adobe !FlashBuilder Premium, however it may be possible to use !FlashDevelop (a free Flex IDE) and it is possible to use other development tools (e.g. Notepad++ and the Flex SDK).
