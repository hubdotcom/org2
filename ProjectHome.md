## Project Information ##
The ORG (OWASP Report Generator) is a multi-purpose reporting tool designed to be extensible for various reporting needs.   By using what is known as a provider model, report providers can be plugged in to ORG.  OWASP Report Providers will include Penetration Testing and SDL.  The Penetration Testing Report Provider supports the documentation and reporting of security vulnerabilities discovered during security audits.  The SDL Report Provider supports the documentation and reporting requirements of the Secure Development Lifecycle.  Beyond OWASP Report Providers, the community can leverage the ORG for their own reporting needs.
